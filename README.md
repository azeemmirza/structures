A JavaScript/TypeScript Collections Library.

## Goal

Are you frequently impressed by the seamless handling of data structures in **C++** using its **STL (Standard Template Library)**, Python's elegant **collections**, or Java's robust **java.util library**?

Your admiration turns into empowerment with the introduction of the **Structures** Library in JavaScript and TypeScript. This library revolutionizes how complex data structures are managed, providing developers with a smooth and efficient experience.

We have conducted and will continue to conduct rigorous benchmarks to compare the performance of Structures with C++ STL, ensuring not just efficiency but also reliability in your projects. Moreover, our commitment to aligning Structures' API standards meticulously with ES6 and Java guarantees a seamless transition for developers, maintaining familiarity while embracing modern practices.

The usability of Structures is designed to match Python's standards, making it a compelling choice for a wide range of modern development projects. Say goodbye to envy and embrace the power and ease of Structures Library for your JavaScript and TypeScript development needs.
